Problem #1: 

I can summarize my data by comparing two groups (long day vs. non-long day) and the average amount of money spent depending on the day. On long days, I'm on campus for more than 5 hours and I feel that I am more tempted to spend money on campus the longer I am here. I can also compare the observations of mean dollars spent on campus between the days that I had breakfast or not. This would allow me to observe if having breakfast might influence whether or not I spend money on campus. 

```{r}
# wrangling and cleaning data

clean_names(ActiveData1)

ggplot(data = ActiveData1,
       aes(x = `Long Day`,
           y = `Money Spent`,
           color = `Money Spent`)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)


```

```{r}
avg_money <- ActiveData1 |> 
  filter(`Long Day` == "Yes") |> 
  summarize(mean_money_yes = mean(`Money Spent`))

avg_money2 <- ActiveData1 |> 
  filter(`Long Day` == "No") |> 
  summarize(mean_money_no = mean(`Money Spent`))




```


Problem #2 

a. Since I am working with how much money I spend while I'm on campus, perhaps I could visualize my data using objects or symbols related to that. I could create a histogram using my data and then use a coffee cup or a yerba mate (both of which I typically spend money on) to indicate the days in which I probably bought one. I like the way my data looks in a simple, vertical jitter plot. Maybe I can draw lines from the points as they ascend using colors to inidicate that lower amounts are better and higher amounts are worse, changing color as the jitter points ascend the graph creating tree-like shapes that

```

d. Artist Statement 
I am showing what I typically spend money on while I'm on campus. Personally, this visualization does represent my need to feel like I'm productive. Yerbs and coffees are caffeinated implying productivity while I'm someone who does not find myself often needing it, however, it's a placebo effect that helps me feel productive. 

For me, the technique of simple line drawing are effective at conveying a message. It evokes a certain kind of nostalgia that takes me back to when I used to draw during recess or for fun at home. 
The form of my work is a drawing that I did in my notes app. 

I created my work by drawing on my ipad and overlaying the drawing/sketches on top of the data visualization that I created. 

Problem #3 

a. The statistical test performed in the study is a multivariate logistic regression. The response variable for the test is the level of contaminant detected in the drinking water and the predictor variables included the drinking fountains, their locations, and sinks.
